<h1><center><i>Project Idea</i></center></h1>

<h3><u>Project Summary</u></h3>
<p>The project is about a mobile flight app. This project is mainly designed to be used by adults. The app will include a QR code where travellers 
can use it to scan and check in through the application rather than standing in a long queue waiting for their turn. The app will also display all 
different flight details such as flight number, flight fare, departure date and so on. In addition, they also can look up on the app for different
 airlines and receive holiday packages that will suit their preference.</p>

<p><h3><u>Motivation</u></h3></p>
<p>This project is useful to customers in many ways. First of all, it provides convenience to customers. Many airlines require 
passengers to be at the airport four hours before boarding time to check in their luggage, get their boarding pass and seat number, etc. 
This app helps customers to take their time to get boarding pass, seat number at their own convenience. And especially to customers who 
always in a rush but do not have any baggage to check in. In addition to that, it also disseminates information faster. For example, there 
will be changes to departure time, flight gates and sometimes it quite hard to hear announcement at the airport. So, having this app will
 help you get notifications and updates about these changes. </p>
 
 <p><h3><u>Features of the Project</u></h3></p>
 <p>First of all, one feature of this app is <b><i>Flight Tracker</i></b>. This feature is for tracking flights. This includes, how far you are from your 
 departure place, destination, also display the arrival time, nearest destination and so forth. It also allows passengers to track how long they 
 have been travelling, how far is from their destination and the total distance of their flight. Apart from that, this feature also allows 
 passengers to track multiple flights. For example, if you are on a different flight with your friend, you can check what time she/he will 
 arrive at the airport. Another feature is <b><i>Trip Planner</i></b>. The users are able to plan their trips on this app. Travellers may save their future
 and past trips using this feature. In addition to that, <b><i>App guidance</b></i> is another one. Guidelines and tips are helpfully shown in this app to 
 guide people. This is the most important feature in the app which will help the user to get familiar with using the app. It provide information of how to
 track the flight, using some other features like playing music and movie. This helps in reducing the education of passengers or users of how to use the app.
 Furthermore, <b><i>PushUp Notification</b></i> is another feature. It will help the travellers updated with any changes  to their flights. But first, the users
 must make sure that their notifications is switch on so that they will not miss any updates.</p>
 
 <p><h3><u>Tools Required for the Project</u></h3></p>
 <p>One of the software needed in this project is Java. Java is one of the programming languages used when creating apps. To create a flight app, 
 the developer will use this software to program how the app is going to work. Solarwinds msp is another software required for this. This software
 will be used for backing up data stored in this app. </p>
 
<p><h3><u>Skills required</u></h3></p>
<p>Some of the skills required for this project are: UX/UI Design Skills, Cross-platform Development skill, expert in programming and so on. In order to get to obtain these
skills, online courses are one way to help  you. Instead of going to a face to face course, looking up online for online courses will makes it easier to gain these skills.
 In addition, practical is another way of getting the skills. For programming, theoretical learning is not enough, putting something into practice everyday will help you
 gain valuable skills. For instance, volunteer and internship will assist you in gaining the skills required for this project. Practising a lot makes everything 
perfect and easy.</p>

<p><h3><u>Outcome</u></h3></p>
<p>If the project is successful, I hope that it will ease the process for travellers to check-in their flight through the application and giving them holiday 
promotions. Furthermore, I also expect that by finishing this project, the travellers will no longer rush to the airport and no longer have problems (delays, cancellation)
with their flights. The impact of this project is that it will take up some opportunities for people working at the airport. If all the travellers are using this app for 
 checking in, that means that the workers (check-in workers) will no longer needed in the workplace.</p>
