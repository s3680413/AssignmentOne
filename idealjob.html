<p>The job holder will be responsible for troubleshooting or configuring network problems, repairing computer hardware (system unit, mouse, CPU, etc).
 Apart from that, they are also responsible for installing software into computers when needed by the company or clients. Back in my island, the 
 government workers have lots of problems with computers and networks. For instance, most of the workers computers are not working, some complained 
 that the network is too slow, and they need to install and run software on their computers, but they find it difficult to do. So, by reading this job, it 
 makes me want to do this kind of job as it is needed as well in my island. </p>
 
 <p>Skills needed for these jobs is collaboration, i.e. you must be able to work in a group. Also have to be critical thinking and know how to solve
 problems. In addition, communication skill also one of the most important skill required for this position. Employers are needed to have a good 
 communication so that they can explain clearly and properly the problems to the customers or users, and the using of the computers. And you must have 
 a certificate or degree in Help Desk. Furthermore, this job holder must have at least two years of work experience in any company or organisation.</p>

<p>Currently, I do not have any IT qualification and skills required for this position. As for experience, even though I had one year of work experience 
in an IT Department back home, but still not suitable or fit for this position. </p>

<p>I need to complete a master in IT (Help Desk) in order to get qualification for this position. In addition to that, I need to do more practicals activities 
related to this position, such as volunteering and internship. Furthermore, I also need to study a lot by myself, by reading notes and by taking online courses.</p><br>
